### Project Title

US Bikeshare Analyse Program

### Description

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three cities in the United States : Chicago, New York City and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
I had also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
